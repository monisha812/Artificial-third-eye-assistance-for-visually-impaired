# Artificial-third-eye-assistance-for-visually-impaired
Though there are certain advantages of using white cane, there are certain challenges people face in their daily lives using white canes. Cane travel can be more cumbersome and not as fluid. Like the cane gets stuck in a crack, weather negatively impacts cane travelers. A six-inch or more snowfall with a cane can really wreak havoc getting around, as it is difficult to tap or sweep the cane and some landmarks may not be available to check your orientation. The motor vehicular movement, use of traffic and environmental unfriendliness are some of the challenges/obstacle's pupils face in white cane usage . So, by considering all these factors, we must move on for a better alternative to white cane for visually impaired. THEREFORE, ARTIFICIAL ASSISTANCE IS BETTER OPTION FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED.
